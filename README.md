## Introduction

This project fine-tunes the GPT-2 language model on book text data to generate text that mimics the style and content of the book. The fine-tuned model can be used to generate text or answer questions based on the book's content.

## Installation

To install and set up this project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehtabafsar/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. 

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the fine-tuned model:

1. **Load the Model and Tokenizer:**

   ```python
   from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel

   model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('./fine_tuned_model')
   tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('./fine_tuned_model')
   ```

2. **Generate Text:**

   ```python
   prompt = "What does Rumi say about love?"
   inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
   outputs = model.generate(inputs['input_ids'], max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)
   generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
   print(generated_text)
   ```

## Features

- Fine-tuned GPT-2 model on book text data.
